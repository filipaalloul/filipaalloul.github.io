        <h1>Pizza Odyssey: Exploring NYC's Boroughs, One Pie at a Time </h1>
        <p>Join Liam Quigley's savory expedition through the vibrant pizza scene in New York City</p>

      <p>Liam Quigley always considered himself a foodie, but there was a certain fascination among a New York pizza slice. His obsessive compulsive disorder prompted for his desire to go on an exploration journey of the map, solely devoted to pizza.
</p>

      <p>“I want to see a lot of different places pop up and fill up the space,” Quigley said, “If I found a pizza place that was really show stopping and my friend was in that neighborhood, they knew who to call and I liked being that go to person”. 

</p>

      <p>Wether it were to satisfy a mid day craving or to grab a late night bite, pizza was most definitely Quigley’s first resort.
</p>

      <p>As his encyclopedic collection of pizza spots grew, he became the go to person with top-notch tastebuds. “I can easily look at the map even if it was a few years ago and gain automatic recollection of the exact slice I had” Quigley said. 
</p>

<iframe title="465 Pizza Joints in 9 years " aria-label="Map" id="datawrapper-chart-CMrnn" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/CMrnn/3/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="746" data-external="1"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var e=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var t in a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<e.length;r++)if(e[r].contentWindow===a.source){var i=a.data["datawrapper-height"][t]+"px";e[r].style.height=i}}}))}();
</script>

      <p>His system was easily accessible. The collection of all these pizza spots ended up not only helping people around Quigley’s close circle but he got the label of “the pizza guy”.
</p>

      <p>Quigley looked up to the present Barstool Sports founder Dave Portnoy’s of the social media industry blowing up simply due to his remarkable pizza ratings. “My approach was more geared toward garnering a sort of pizza encyclopedia for people rather than rating it” Quigley said. “If it wasn’t a good spot and didn’t meet my standards  it just wouldn’t make the list”. His experienced tastebuds for pizza assured that he knew how to guide others on the right track. 

</p>

      <p>The instant gratification of a pizza slice is in high demand in the eye of a New Yorker. “The average New Yorker wants a quality slice with a good price” Quigley said. “We try to avoid 1$ slices” he added. 
</p>

      <p>In the bustling streets of New York City, pizza is not just a meal; its a way of life. New Yorkers are on the constant quest for the ideal pizza slice that marries good quality coupled with an affordable price.

      <p>Among the five boroughs of New York City, pizzerias line every block. Quigley, born and raised in Brooklyn has made his way around the boroughs to 465 different pizza spots logging them since 2014. He completed an undergraduate degree in Journalism and a graduate degree in Photography. "My passion for food, pictures and reporting on my experiences was perfect for this pizza journey of mine" said Quigley. 

</p>

      <p>“Jamaica Island Margarita Pizza is the best slice and is mouthwatering, it also has a great ambiance” says Quigley.  When it comes to a late night spot after an outing, “Bleeker street pizza and Joe’s pizza are the best late night go to” he added. 

</p>

      <p>Standards for pizza are as high as skyscrapers in Manhattan.  “It would be a bad pizza place if there wasn’t a long line, that’s how we do it”. “If I walk past a pizzeria that has 5 people waiting outside, i’m walking to the next pizza stop” said Quigley. 

</p>

      <p>“I got a 1$ pizza slice the other day because its convenient, it was right there” he added.

</p>
      
      <p>In the wake of the pandemic’s aftermath, a present trend has emerged within the food industry, marking an increase in prices which has impacted pizza.  This trend has prompted for concerns of affordability among consumers as they grapple to navigate a landscape where access to basic food has become an adversity. 
</p>
      <p>“The cost of living in New York City is highly expensive, which justifies why people have incentives to spend less money in all ranges of their spending” said Quigley. 
</p>
      <p>Liam Quigley is a man who has spent $1244 across the duration of his pizza journey. Among that total amount, $955 was spent on plain slices, and $202.28 was spent on pepperoni slices. In his home neighborhood of Brooklyn, he has spent $476 worth of pizza slices during a 9 year time span as well as $492 in Manhattan where he worked.
</p>
     
     <iframe title="Plain &amp;amp; Pepperoni Pizza Slice Cost Average: 2014-2022" aria-label="Interactive line chart" id="datawrapper-chart-q9qyp" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/q9qyp/3/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="400" data-external="1"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var e=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var t in a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<e.length;r++)if(e[r].contentWindow===a.source){var i=a.data["datawrapper-height"][t]+"px";e[r].style.height=i}}}))}();

      <p>Amelia Pollard reported on <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2022-pizza-principle-transit-fare-price/">Bloomberg</a> publication in April 2022 that prices for plain slices are soaring above $3 throughout the city along with commodity and labor costs. With the Metropolitan Transportation Authority freezing fares at $2.75, the gap between the price of riding downtown and satisfying late-night hunger pangs is growing quickly.
</p>
     
     <p>Prices have not only increased in Manhattan where we would most expect it, but across the other boroughs, prices are soaring as well. “We really started noticing a change consecutive to the pandemic when people were money hungry and small businesses were suffering” said Quigley. 
</p>
     <p>Inflation has cast a looming shadow over New York’s pizza landscape, altering it on both sides of the consumer and owner respectively. The rise in costs for ingredients that go toward creating that “ideal slice” have taken a toll on pizzerias in each of the five boroughs battling with these price hikes. 
</p>
     <p>Flour, cheese, tomatoes and even oils necessary for the cooking process of pizza have dented profit margins due to the inflation that has taken over in the most recent years. With such a vibrant and loyal pizza community, these pizzerias are working night and day grappling with these changes to maintain their usual quality to satisfy consumers tastebuds. 
</p>
     
    <p>According to Amelia Pollard from Bloomberg, “Cheese prices haven’t increased as fast as those other food items during the pandemic, but they are still up about 10% over three years, according to the bureau”. 
</p>

    <p>"I had a conversation with a pizza owner down in Jamaica and he spoke about how when the pandemic hit and public transportation became a ghost town during lockdown, his pizza shop lost its vibrance, its ambiance and lost its spark next to the Jamaica train station that attracted individuals to his small corner shop” Said Quigley. “This really hit home because I knew how serious and deep this was to him, and I knew prices would only get worse due to inflation” he added.

</p>



     <p> Pizza is a major facet of the New York culture. “My pizza journey was a wun-off type thing, I loved being the person people would call for pizza, and I loved reporting on food, specifically pizza” said Quigley.
